# Data Security Enhancement Plan

## Background and Motivation
The current application stores sensitive business data (bookings, clients, invoices, etc.) directly in the frontend using localStorage. This poses several security risks:
1. Data is easily accessible and modifiable by anyone with browser access
2. No data encryption
3. No user authentication/authorization
4. No data backup mechanism
5. Limited data size due to localStorage constraints
6. No data validation or sanitization

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Data Structure:
   - Complex nested data with relationships (clients, bookings, activities, etc.)
   - Sensitive information (client details, financial data, employee records)
   - Real-time updates needed for bookings and invoices

2. Security Requirements:
   - Secure storage of sensitive data in Supabase
   - User authentication and authorization using Supabase Auth
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Regular backups (handled by Supabase)
   - Audit logging

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Fast data access for real-time operations
   - Efficient querying of related data
   - Scalability for growing data volume

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Supabase Setup

   - Dependencies: Supabase SQL editor

3. [ ] Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Success Criteria: Proper access control policies in place
   - Dependencies: Supabase policies

### Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization

   - Dependencies: @supabase/supabase-js

2. [ ] Implement authentication UI
   - Success Criteria: Login form and user session management
   - Dependencies: Supabase Auth UI components

### Phase 5: Deployment & Security
1. [ ] Set up Vercel deployment

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Initial planning phase
- Supabase project URL and API key available
- Ready to begin implementation

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Awaiting confirmation to proceed with Phase 1
- Need to create .env.local file for local development
- Need to set up Vercel environment variables

## Environment Variables Structure
```env
# Local Development (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Vercel Environment Variables
# Same as above, configured in Vercel dashboard
```

## Lessons
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper error handling for Supabase operations
- Use Supabase's built-in security features
- Regular security audits should be performed
- Implement rate limiting where necessary
- Keep Supabase service role key secure and never expose it to the client
