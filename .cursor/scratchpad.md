# Data Security Enhancement Plan

## Background and Motivation
The current application stores sensitive data in localStorage, which poses several security risks:
- Data is accessible to anyone with access to the browser
- No encryption of sensitive information
- Limited storage capacity
- No backup mechanism
- No data validation

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Data Structure
   - Complex relationships between entities (clients, bookings, invoices, etc.)
   - Need to maintain data integrity and relationships
   - Need to handle concurrent access

2. Security Requirements
   - Secure storage of sensitive data
   - Role-based access control
   - Data encryption at rest
   - Secure API endpoints

3. Performance Considerations
   - Efficient querying of related data
   - Proper indexing for common queries
   - Caching strategy for frequently accessed data

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Supabase Setup ✅
- [x] Create database schema
- [x] Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
- [x] Create indexes for performance
- [x] Set up triggers for updated_at timestamps
- [x] Configure Supabase client

### Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization ✅
- [x] Set up Supabase Auth
- [x] Create admin role
- [x] Implement RLS policies for admin
- [x] Add authentication UI components
- [x] Set up protected routes

### Phase 3: API Development ✅
- [x] Create API endpoints for each entity
- [x] Implement data validation
- [x] Add error handling
- [x] Set up rate limiting
- [x] Add request logging

### Phase 4: Frontend Migration
- [x] Update data access layer to use Supabase
- [x] Create data migration script
- [ ] Update UI components
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Implement error handling

### Phase 5: Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add data encryption
- [ ] Implement audit logging
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Add security headers
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Completed Phase 1: Supabase Setup
  - Created comprehensive database schema with all necessary tables
  - Set up Row Level Security on all tables
  - Created indexes for common queries
  - Set up triggers for updated_at timestamps
  - Created Supabase client configuration with TypeScript types
- Completed Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization
  - Set up Supabase Auth with email/password authentication
  - Created admin role and restricted access to specific email
  - Implemented RLS policies for all tables
  - Created authentication UI components
  - Set up protected routes
- Completed Phase 3: API Development
  - Created a comprehensive API client with CRUD operations for all entities
  - Implemented Zod validation schemas for data integrity
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Set up TypeScript types for better type safety
  - Implemented relationship handling for complex entities
- In Progress Phase 4: Frontend Migration
  - Created a new data access layer with state management and TypeScript types
  - Created a data migration script to move data from localStorage to Supabase
  - Next steps: Update UI components to use the new data layer

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Ready to proceed with updating UI components to use the new data layer
- Need to confirm if there are any specific UI components that need to be prioritized

## Lessons
1. Always use TypeScript types for better type safety and developer experience
2. Set up proper indexes for common queries to ensure good performance
3. Use Row Level Security to enforce data access at the database level
4. Keep track of created_at and updated_at timestamps for all records
5. Use proper foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity
6. Implement authentication at the database level using RLS policies
7. Use protected routes to ensure only authenticated users can access the application
8. Use Zod for runtime data validation to ensure data integrity
9. Implement proper error handling and logging for better debugging
10. Use TypeScript's utility types for better type safety in API operations
11. Use a state management system to handle data updates and UI synchronization
12. Create a data migration script to ensure smooth transition from old to new data storage
